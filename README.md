# tetris_game
This a Tetris game implemented in JS.<br>I am following an online tutorial on the Electro-info site (you can follow <a href=https://www.electro-info.ovh/TP-programmation-Javascript-jeu-Tetris>this link</a>).<br>
My goal is to learn JS with fun.<br>

Currently working on little improvements because the 7 parts are finished.<br>
However, the game is working just fine ! Have fun !

To start the game, just clone the repo and open the file <b>tetris.html</b> on your favorite web browser.
